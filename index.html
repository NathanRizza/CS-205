				<h3>Exceptional Quality</h3>
				<p>
				It is our goal to provide you with gourmet Pizza from an authentic Italian restaurant.
				Our restaurant has been in business for over 50 years and during this time we have perfected our craft.
				Each chef that dawns an apron at our establishment has graduated top of their class in culinary school
				and had numerous years of experience. At Rizza’s Pizzas we believe you deserve nothing short of perfection,
				which is why we buy only high-end local ingredients.
				</p>
 
				<p>
				Pizza is our main staple item, and we offer the dish in an endless number of combinations. 
				However, we are not limited to just Pizza and offer other main dishes, including pastas, meats, and seafood ensuring that there will be something for everyone. 
				In addition to our handcrafted pizza, we also serve a large variety of alcoholic beverages. 
				Our persistence in customer satisfaction and culinary expertise is why we have a three Michelin Stars, signifying a mastery of our chef’s craft.
				</p>
 
				<h3>How we Operate:</h3>
				<p>
				What makes our business distinct from other pizza-focused establishments is how we operate our business. 
				At Rizza’s Pizzas we do not take walk in order or takeout. 
				The only way to experience our pizza is to make a reservation where you place an order in advance. 
				This allows us to purchase the exact ingredients we will need, so that our ingredients are always fresh. 
				While dining with us it is our mission to ensure you have a fulfilling experience which is why we provide a complimentary bottle of wine during your stay. 
				We also provide live music performed by Baroque and  Classical pianists. 
				It is our hope that the atmosphere and culture presented by our establishment fills you with the satisfaction lasting beyond your stay.
				</p>
 
				<h3>Why we're Special:</h3>
				<p>
				What makes our pizza special is the science we put into making them. 
				Our Chefs are bound to not disclose the secrets discovered by the founder Nero Rizza. 
				To understand what makes our Pizza special can only be communicated by trying the dish. 
				We have reinvented the idea of Pizza and provide flavors and experiences that are not found at any other place on earth.
