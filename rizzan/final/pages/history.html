			<h3>About US:</h3>
				<p>
				Rizza’s Pizzas was founded in 1968 by Nero Rizza, a descendant of the inventor of pizza. 
				Through the struggle of political unrest during the time, Nero sold all of his belongings to buy a one story 15 square meter building where he would sell Pizza. 
				Learning from his grandmother, Nero’s culinary talent allowed him to attract quite a following. 
				Not soon after, the building was remodeled into the exquisite architecture that we have today. 
				What made Rizza’s Pizzas so successful was that after finding a stable foothold Nero was able to focus on his passion in the craft. 
				Constantly improving upon recipes, Nero hoped to deliver the best experience possible for all his customers. 
				One day in the spring of 1973 Nero fell in love with the nice lady who would drop off the restaurants ingredients. 
				After they married they would have Angelo Rizza. 
				Nero’s heath declined in 2005 and, surrounded by loved ones he passed down the family business to Angelo 
				who has worked rigorously and achieved his father’s dreams of becoming a world renowned restaurant.
